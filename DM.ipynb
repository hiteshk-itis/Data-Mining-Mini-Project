In 8th Intl Workshop on Expert\n","\n","   Systems and their Applications, Avignon, France. pages 59-78, 1988.\n","\n","\n","\n","   Within machine-learning, this dataset was used for the evaluation\n","\n","   of HINT (Hierarchy INduction Tool), which was proved to be able to\n","\n","   completely reconstruct the original hierarchical model.

Relevant Information Paragraph:\n","\n","\n","\n","   Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical\n","\n","   decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX\n","\n","   (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision\n","\n","   making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.). The model evaluates\n","\n","   cars according to the following concept structure:\n","\n","\n","\n","   CAR                      car acceptability\n","\n","   . PRICE                  overall price\n","\n","   . . buying               buying price\n","\n","   . . maint                price of the maintenance\n","\n","   .

Besides the target\n","\n","   concept (CAR), the model includes three intermediate concepts:\n","\n","   PRICE, TECH, COMFORT.
